Issues encountered:

1. Generate provider or remote_state blocks in common.hcl
    - Do not move provider or remote_state blocks to common.hcl as it doesn't support include context.
    - When using read_terragrunt_config(), common.hcl is only read — it doesn't pass include context. So functions like path_relative_to_include() will return "." and state paths will break.
    - generate only works if the file is included as part of the Terragrunt hierarchy (e.g., root.hcl), not just read with read_terragrunt_config().
    - read_terragrunt_config() → only loads locals and inputs, but ignores generate, remote_state, and dependency blocks.

2. Expose attribute on include
    - include "root" needs expose = true to share locals
    - By default, locals defined in an included file are not exposed to the including file. If you want to expose them, you must set expose = true in the include block.
  Error type given:
    [Partial] Included config ./root.hcl has strategy shallow merge: merging config in (shallow).

    include "root" {
      path   = find_in_parent_folders("root.hcl")
      expose = true
    }
